We are using CMake to govern the build process, the only supported platform is Linux/gcc. Others can be added in CMakeLists.txt
Building the application

In order to build the code, you need to create a build directory, generate the makefile and build:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j3

which should produce a 'MCSimulation' executable for you.
